Youâ€™ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. 
You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches 
a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` 
and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also provides support for highlighting the syntax of code snippets:

{% highlight python %}
def print_hello_world(): 
    # print "hello world!" in terminal
    print('hello world!')
{% endhighlight %}



#### __Display math equations using MathJax__

An example of math equations in Jekyll (MathJax):

$$
  y(x_i) = f(x_i) + \epsilon(x_i)
$$

MathJax can be imported externally inside the `header` of `/_layouts/x.html` to allow posts that use `x.html` as layout to display math
equations as follow:

{% highlight html %}
<script type="text/x-mathjax-config">
    MathJax.Hub.Config({
        jax: ["input/TeX","output/HTML-CSS"],
        displayAlign: "left",
        displayIndent: "5em"
    });
</script>
<script 
    src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.0/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML" 
    type="text/javascript">
</script>
{% endhighlight %}

This blog's [repo] provides a working example of Jekyll default theme (Minima) with MathJax installed.
